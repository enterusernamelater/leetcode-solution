/*
 * this package contains my leetcode binary search question solutions. 
 * the hardest part in binary search tree imo is how you break out of the loop
 * question 34 will teach you how to break out the loop
 * basically the idea is on each loop finding mid either l has the increment or r 
 * has to decrement from mid. when l = mid  l cannot equal to it original val. 
 * when r = mid r cannot equal to it original value as well.
